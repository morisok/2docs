## The first encounter

- Date: 27.12.2024
- Time: 5:24pm
- Events:
  - First screenshot has been created
  - Mr O finds out:
    - In panic, he goes silent, turning of his camera
    - He immediately stops screensharing
    - He leaves the 2 discord servers
    - He starts screensharing again as if nothing ever happened
 - More details:
    - He tried making an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) which at first was just a sentence which was "You are legally binded  not to say anything about the info I will tell you about the servers"
    - Then "he" "improved" it to an actual document which had a number of errors
    - I sent him an improved version to check if he was fine with it and he said yes
    - Then I signed the actual document which was still so bad it prevented me from saying information THAT I DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW, which, basically made it useless

## The second encounter

- Date: 9.03.2025
- Time: around 2:00pm (exact time unknown)
- Events:
  - Sadly, no screenshot has been created
  - Mr Om asks Mr O to screenshare him going through his search history
  - When he goes through Discord, you can see a server with a name similar to "Sparklze something something ðŸ”ž"
  - Mr O instantly figures it out:
    - He is scrolling very quickly, so I couldn't take a screenshot
    - He, again, went completly silent
    - He stops screensharing, clears his history other than his DMs between me and him
    - He starts screensharing again, and the server is not there anymore
- More details:
  - I try to convince him to tell me the name of the Discord server, but refuses
  - I send him an invite to a Discord server which had a bunch of servers similar to the server I saw in his history, he refused (Musavir.ai)

## Ms L

- Date: 11.03.2025 - now
- Events:
  - He started dating Ms L around Tuesday 11.03.2025
  - Mr Os asked her if she knew what the 2 discord servers were, she said that she only knew that they were very inappropriate
  - Mr O then was very angry at Mr Os because he thought that he told her what the servers are, he did not
  - Someone tells TMA that Mr O and Ms L are dating
  - Mr O decides to tell us, even though we knew from the first day
- More details:
  - Mr O acts in a weird way when around Ms L
  - Mr O told Ms L what the 2 servers were, she was annoyed, but not angry
